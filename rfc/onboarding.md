## Recent Enhancements ✅ JANUARY 2024

### Keyboard Navigation Implementation
- **Step 1 (Name)**: Enter key on name input triggers continue when name is filled
- **Step 2 (Work)**: Enter key on job title or company inputs triggers continue when both are filled
- **Step 3 (Contacts)**: Enter key on email or phone inputs triggers continue
- **Step 4 (Sign Up)**: Enter key on email or password inputs triggers sign up when both are filled and not loading

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Enhanced Step Components with Keyboard Support
const handleKeyDown = (e: React.KeyboardEvent) => {
  if (e.key === 'Enter' && isValidForProgression()) {
    handleContinue();
  }
};

// Validation Integration
const isValidForProgression = () => {
  // Step-specific validation logic
  return fieldsAreValid && !isLoading;
};
```
